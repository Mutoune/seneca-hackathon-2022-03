### Background and Context 

While housing affordability is a key element in building sustainable urban places, Canada’s largest cities have been facing a chronic housing crisis just like their international counterparts. The affordability crisis has since spilled over to rural and smaller communities in recent years.  Marginalized and racialized communities impacted particularly hard by the crisis as decades of systemic racism has deeply entrenched in housing arrangement. The increasing cost of homeownership push these communities away from achieving positive health, social, education and career outcomes.

Traditionally, tackling housing affordability is perceived to be the government and non-profit sectors’ jurisdictions. However, we should recognize the far-reaching impact of the housing crisis, the need for prompt responses, as well as the capacities from the private sector that could be leveraged.  Historically, governments focus on demand-side solutions that aim to cool down the property market. The trend for home prices demonstrated that these measures are insufficient as population growth continues to outpace the supply of new homes. It is important to recognize that demand-side solutions are as effective as the numbers of units available in the market. Unless more housing units are being created, our society will continue to be impacted by the negative outcomes from the housing affordability crisis.

There are a number of other issues that the housing sector also needs to tackle. There are misaligned interest amongst housing stakeholders (e.g., developers, new-homebuyers, existing homeowners, governments, non-profit organizations, consultants and contractors etc.) that slows down or prevent sufficient supply of housing. Developing affordable homes is particularly difficult because of the financial and feasibility constraints. The system is also fragmented and lack transparency as affordable home seekers do not have a centralized and easy to navigate channel to find and apply for affordable housing units / programs. Lastly, marginalized and racialized communities are often neglected in the decision-making process for housing policies. These inefficiencies further add to the difficulties in providing equitable access to affordable homes.

### Objective/Solution

Our objective is to use technological innovations to create an ecosystem that could mitigate if not eliminate the inefficiencies and misalignments amongst stakeholders. As the Province commits to create 1.5 million housing units in the next 10 years to fulfill the latent and projected demand, our solution intends to serve as a platform that support this cause. We intend to create more meaningful partnerships, and therefore the creation of more housing units.

We are challenging you to create an ecosystem that may incorporate some of the following: blockchain technologies, NFTs, machine learning and data intelligence, with the following objectives in mind:

*   Facilitate the formation of lasting partnerships among stakeholders
*   Incorporate different housing stakeholders into this solution
*   Reduce misaligned incentives among stakeholders
*   Streamline the affordable home finding and application processes
*   Improve transparency of the affordable housing allocation and lifecycle tracking processes
*   Create Long term impacts to housing affordability
*   Attract new ideas and resources from members of the ecosystem
*   Empower marginalized and racialized communities in the decision-making process.
*   Consider the needs of all stakeholders, particularly those who will be most affected by this solution

The final product will be a no-code working prototype created using Bubble.io. We will provide you with access.

Be creative!
